Project on fitness values correction coming from Tn-seq analysis on S. pneumoniae.

By using Tn-seq insertion counts data from https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1377 highlight the relationship among position of the gene on the chromosome and fitness.

The vignette for this project can be seen at https://daniele.codes/TnSeq-project/
